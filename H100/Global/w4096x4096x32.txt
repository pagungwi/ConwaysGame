    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          6.55 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.40 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 13.5 cycles being stalled waiting on a fixed latency execution    
          dependency. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in         
          already highly optimized kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the       
          number of active warps, restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to         
          lower-latency instructions, e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options. This stall type represents      
          about 77.3% of the total average of 17.5 cycles between issuing two instructions.

          This kernel has uncoalesced global accesses resulting in a total of 28862344 excessive sectors (74% of the    
          total 38919004 sectors). Check the L2 Theoretical Sectors Global Excessive table for the primary source       
          locations. The CUDA Programming Guide
