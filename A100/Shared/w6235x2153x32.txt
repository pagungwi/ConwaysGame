    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          6.99 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.34 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 14.1 cycles being stalled waiting on a fixed latency execution    
          dependency. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in         
          already highly optimized kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the       
          number of active warps, restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to         
          lower-latency instructions, e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options. This stall type represents      
          about 64.3% of the total average of 21.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.

    INF   Check the Warp Stall Sampling (All Samples) table for the top stall locations in your source based on

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 23.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 23.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
