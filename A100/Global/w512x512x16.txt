    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.5 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          8.21 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.63 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 13.5 cycles being stalled waiting on a fixed latency execution    
          dependency. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in         
          already highly optimized kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the       
          number of active warps, restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to         
          lower-latency instructions, e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options. This stall type represents      
          about 66.2% of the total average of 20.4 cycles between issuing two instructions.

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 375 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 33.8%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          The difference between calculated theoretical (75.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (49.7%) can be the

          The 12.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the      
          hardware maximum of 16. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (75.0%) is limited by the number of required      
          registers.
