    OPT   Compute is more heavily utilized than Memory: Look at the Compute Workload Analysis section to see what the   
          compute pipelines are spending their time doing. Also, consider whether any computation is redundant and

    OPT   ALU is the highest-utilized pipeline (74.0%) based on active cycles, taking into account the rates of its     
          different instructions. It executes integer and logic operations. The pipeline is well-utilized, but might    
          become a bottleneck if more work is added. Based on the number of executed instructions, the highest          
          utilized pipeline (74.0%) is ALU. It executes integer and logic operations. Comparing the two, the overall    
          pipeline utilization appears to be caused by frequent, low-latency instructions. See the Kernel Profiling     
          Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-decoder) or hover over the

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          9.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.70 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 13.5 cycles being stalled waiting on a fixed latency execution    
          dependency. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in         
          already highly optimized kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the       
          number of active warps, restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to         
          lower-latency instructions, e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options. This stall type represents      
          about 70.0% of the total average of 19.3 cycles between issuing two instructions.
